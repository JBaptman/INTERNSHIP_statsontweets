Here is the work I have done while I was in Ireland for a 3-month long internship.

I had to gather tweets, and by processing them, I had to extract information, that's what the scripts do. 
In the data folder, there is 3 JSON files that contain 10,000 english tweets, 10,000 french tweets and 10,000 german tweets + 1 CSV file that contains 3,000 tweets in English about the #GE16 in Ireland.
